## Private
We concern about your privacy very much that we never stored any data to server, but instead store at client-side (Indexed Database) for the fastest and safest performance instead.

## No Advertisement
We are largly invested for the best User Experience so we made it consistency, fluid and most user-friendly as much as we can. Advertisement is annoying and we userstand that, we also annoyed at it to, so we made it ads free.

## Progressive
We use `React.js` for the best web application performance since we have a LOT DOM changing in our site  

We use `Typescript`, correcting data structure, secure a element's type. Made it secure and fast.  

We have `Dynamic Routing` which based on client-side, so now we you request for the next page, it's all done in your browser which made it blazing fast.  

We use an `Indexed Database` which store every data at your browser, made it never request any data from server and can be fetched in your browser which made it faster than any cloud database and the most secure ever (Since there's no data sharing).  

We built an `Progressive Web App` which mean, you can add this web application to homescreen at your grab.
We `cache` it and request it from your disk, made the web load faster at next level.
